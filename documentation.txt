Create a New Project:
In Laragon's www folder, create a subfolder like butchery-pos.
Access it via browser: http://butchery-pos.test (Laragon auto-handles virtual hosts).
For XAMPP: http://localhost/butchery-pos.

Install Additional Tools:
Use Composer (included in Laragon) for PHP dependencies: Run composer require ... in your project folder.
For frontend: Download Bootstrap (CSS/JS framework) or use CDN.
Code editor: VS Code (free) with extensions like PHP Intelephense and MySQL.

Create init.sql and import
